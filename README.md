### Create a game based on Unity Playground.

#### Requirements:

- No violence

- Multiplayer cooperative on same keyboard where players have different abilities / roles

- 3 levels (or endless)

- No external assets – using only assets from Playground. You can combine them with basic Unity objects

#### Evaluation Criteria:

Ease of play –playable with no instructions (on screen text or limited intro text is OK)

Interdependency – neither player should be able to advance or win by themselves

Execution – Looks and feels like a game, sufficiently different from examples

Creativity – Unique is good, as long as it is executed well
